As Henson explained, \"Kermit started out as a way of building, putting a mouth and covering over my hand.

When he wasn't being disturbed, Kermit would occasionally sing to an imaginary audience at home; on one occasion, he performed \"<a href=\"\/wiki\/My_Polliwog_Ways\" title=\"My Polliwog Ways\">My Polliwog Ways<\/a>\" while imagining that his living room was a nightclub full of guests. Kermit also took part in several <a href=\"\/wiki\/Muppet_%26_Kid_Moments:_Kermit\" title=\"Muppet &amp; Kid Moments: Kermit\">talk spots with kids<\/a>.\n<\/p><p>Unlike other <i>Sesame Street<\/i> characters, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Sesame_Workshop\" title=\"Sesame Workshop\">Sesame Workshop<\/a> never had any ownership of Kermit the Frog. Because of this, Kermit has rarely been part of <i>Sesame Street<\/i> merchandise. He has appeared in many <i>Sesame Street<\/i> videos, most notably <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Big_Bird%27s_Storytime\" title=\"Big Bird&#39;s Storytime\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Big Bird's Storytime<\/a><\/i> and, of course, <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/The_Best_of_Kermit_on_Sesame_Street\" title=\"The Best of Kermit on Sesame Street\">The Best of Kermit on Sesame Street<\/a><\/i>. His songs have also appeared on many <i>Sesame Street<\/i> albums.

There will be no more know-it-all frog, since Kermit, the one Muppet who is not exclusive to Sesame Street, is opting out to do commercials\" (<i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Look\" title=\"Look\">Look<\/a><\/i>, Sept. 22, 1970). <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/TIME\" title=\"TIME\">Time Magazine<\/a><\/i> reported with slightly more detail: \"Kermit the Frog is being canned for commercialism. When Sesame Street was just a glint in <a href=\"\/wiki\/Joan_Ganz_Cooney\" title=\"Joan Ganz Cooney\">Joan Ganz Cooney<\/a>'s eye, Kermit taped a special in Canada. When it was given a network airing, the frog was compromised. Or so Henson decided. .... He is being phased out of the show.

Ultimately, of course, that did not turn out to be the case, as Kermit returned as a regular <i>Sesame Street<\/i> character in <a href=\"\/wiki\/Season_3_(1971-1972)\" title=\"Season 3 (1971-1972)\">the third season<\/a> (1971).\n<\/p><p><i>See also <a href=\"\/wiki\/Kermit_the_Frog_on_Sesame_Street\" title=\"Kermit the Frog on Sesame Street\">Kermit the Frog on Sesame Street<\/a>.<\/i>\n<\/p>\n<h2 id='Specials' >Specials<\/h2>\n<p><img src='data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D' class='article-media' data-ref='7' width='600' height='899' \/>\nKermit has appeared in almost every major special from <a href=\"\/wiki\/The_Jim_Henson_Company\" title=\"The Jim Henson Company\">The Jim Henson Company<\/a>.

In <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/The_Muppet_Show:_Sex_and_Violence\" title=\"The Muppet Show: Sex and Violence\">The Muppet Show: Sex and Violence<\/a><\/i>, Kermit appeared in the audience during the wrestling sketches, and had one line in \"<a href=\"\/wiki\/At_the_Dance\" title=\"At the Dance\">At the Dance<\/a>.\" After that special was made, Jim Henson realized that the pilot's host, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Nigel_(Muppet_Show)\" title=\"Nigel (Muppet Show)\">Nigel<\/a>, was not working out as a main character, and it was suggested to Henson that Kermit be the star instead.<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">[10]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>Since Kermit was the main character on <i>The Muppet Show<\/i>, it makes sense that he appeared in every special relating to <i>The Muppet Show<\/i>, usually as the main character.

In <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/The_Muppets_at_Walt_Disney_World\" title=\"The Muppets at Walt Disney World\">The Muppets at Walt Disney World<\/a><\/i>, it was revealed that the swamp where he grew up at is located near <a href=\"\/wiki\/Walt_Disney_World\" title=\"Walt Disney World\">Walt Disney World<\/a>.\n<\/p><p>Kermit was one of the main characters in the hour-long TV special <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/A_Muppets_Christmas:_Letters_to_Santa\" title=\"A Muppets Christmas: Letters to Santa\">A Muppets Christmas: Letters to Santa<\/a><\/i> that aired on <a href=\"\/wiki\/NBC\" title=\"NBC\">NBC<\/a>, and also appeared in the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Studio_DC:_Almost_Live\" title=\"Studio DC: Almost Live\">Studio DC: Almost Live<\/a> specials that aired on <a href=\"\/wiki\/Disney_Channel\" title=\"Disney Channel\">Disney Channel<\/a>.\n<\/p>\n<h2 id='The_Muppet_Show' >The Muppet Show<\/h2>\n<p><img src='data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D' class='article-media gallery' data-ref='2' width='556' height='770' \/>\nKermit became a star when he hosted <i>The Muppet Show<\/i>, acting as the host and the person ultimately in charge of what went on during the show. During the first season, it seemed as if he treated his fellow cast and crew members more like employees, but later on, as the characters developed, it became clear that they were his friends as well.\n<\/p><p>In addition to hosting, Kermit regularly got to chat with the guest stars, in the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Panel_Discussions\" title=\"Panel Discussions\">Panel Discussions<\/a> and <a href=\"\/wiki\/Talk_Spots\" title=\"Talk Spots\">Talk Spots<\/a>, as well as backstage and in some numbers.

He was often pursued by Miss Piggy, who made no secret of her love for him, but Kermit generally rebuffed her advances. Although Piggy loved him, that didn't stop her from karate-chopping him whenever she got mad at him. Miss Piggy unsuccessfully tried to make Kermit jealous of guest star <a href=\"\/wiki\/Avery_Schreiber\" title=\"Avery Schreiber\">Avery Schreiber<\/a>, but on some occasions Kermit actually has gotten jealous of male guest stars who Piggy liked, including <a href=\"\/wiki\/Peter_Ustinov\" title=\"Peter Ustinov\">Peter Ustinov<\/a> and <a href=\"\/wiki\/Christopher_Reeve\" title=\"Christopher Reeve\">Christopher Reeve<\/a>. Kermit has also performed a few duets with Miss Piggy, such as \"<a href=\"\/wiki\/Waiting_at_the_Church\" title=\"Waiting at the Church\">Waiting at the Church<\/a>\", \"<a href=\"\/wiki\/Ukulele_Lady\" title=\"Ukulele Lady\">Ukulele Lady<\/a>\", and \"<a href=\"\/wiki\/I_Won%27t_Dance\" title=\"I Won&#39;t Dance\">I Won't Dance<\/a>\".

In <a href=\"\/wiki\/Episode_211:_Dom_DeLuise\" title=\"Episode 211: Dom DeLuise\">episode 211<\/a>, Miss Piggy had <a href=\"\/wiki\/Scooter\" title=\"Scooter\">Scooter<\/a> pay the audience to cheer at her so that Kermit would notice her more. In <a href=\"\/wiki\/Episode_423:_Carol_Channing\" title=\"Episode 423: Carol Channing\">episode 423<\/a>, Miss Piggy got some shoes that were too small for her feet, but when Kermit complimented on the shoes, she reluctantly kept them. One of the biggest episodes for them was <a href=\"\/wiki\/Episode_502:_Loretta_Swit\" title=\"Episode 502: Loretta Swit\">episode 502<\/a>, in which, after being annoyed over Miss Piggy telling the gossip papers that they were secretly married, Kermit fired Miss Piggy. However, Kermit eventually did hire her back.

Kermit let Fozzie help him plan the show for <a href=\"\/wiki\/Episode_201:_Don_Knotts\" title=\"Episode 201: Don Knotts\">episode 201<\/a>, and when Kermit suddenly became sick in <a href=\"\/wiki\/Episode_206:_Nancy_Walker\" title=\"Episode 206: Nancy Walker\">episode 206<\/a>, Kermit chose to put Fozzie in charge of hosting.\n<\/p><p>Other episodes illustrating Kermit and Fozzie's relationship include <a href=\"\/wiki\/Episode_122:_Ethel_Merman\" title=\"Episode 122: Ethel Merman\">episode 122<\/a>, in which Fozzie brings his agent, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Irving_Bizarre\" title=\"Irving Bizarre\">Irving Bizarre<\/a>, to the theater to negotiate Fozzie's contract with Kermit; <a href=\"\/wiki\/Episode_303:_Roy_Clark\" title=\"Episode 303: Roy Clark\">episode 303<\/a>, in which, after Fozzie mistakenly sends the stagehands to the country, Kermit makes Fozzie do their work, threatening to fire him if he blunders; and <a href=\"\/wiki\/Episode_105:_Rita_Moreno\" title=\"Episode 105: Rita Moreno\">episode 105<\/a>, where Kermit kept asking Fozzie who the many phone calls to the theater were from.\n<\/p><p>Although he generally functions as the \"normal\" and calm center of the show, at times, Kermit would panic or become annoyed and frustrated with the chaos around him. Sources of his frustration include the antics of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Dr._Bunsen_Honeydew\" title=\"Dr. Bunsen Honeydew\">Dr. Bunsen Honeydew<\/a>'s teleportation device (in <a href=\"\/wiki\/Episode_219:_Peter_Sellers\" title=\"Episode 219: Peter Sellers\">episode 219<\/a>), the presence of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Mickey_Moose\" title=\"Mickey Moose\">Mickey Moose<\/a> (in <a href=\"\/wiki\/Episode_220:_Petula_Clark\" title=\"Episode 220: Petula Clark\">episode 220<\/a>) and a robot version of himself (in <a href=\"\/wiki\/Episode_104:_Ruth_Buzzi\" title=\"Episode 104: Ruth Buzzi\">episode 104<\/a>), and the various pranks pulled by Fozzie in <a href=\"\/wiki\/Episode_115:_Candice_Bergen\" title=\"Episode 115: Candice Bergen\">episode 115<\/a>. Kermit expressed annoyance at the acts proposed by <a href=\"\/wiki\/Gonzo\" title=\"Gonzo\">Gonzo<\/a> for the show and <a href=\"\/wiki\/Crazy_Harry\" title=\"Crazy Harry\">Crazy Harry<\/a>'s many explosions, and was discomfited by <a href=\"\/wiki\/Scooter\" title=\"Scooter\">Scooter's<\/a> frequent reminders that his <a href=\"\/wiki\/J.P._Grosse\" title=\"J.P. Grosse\" class=\"mw-redirect\">uncle<\/a> owned the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Muppet_Theater\" title=\"Muppet Theater\" class=\"mw-redirect\">theater<\/a>.\n<\/p><p>Kermit has had major parts in many episodes of the show, and many episodes revolved around Kermit. In <a href=\"\/wiki\/Episode_112:_Peter_Ustinov\" title=\"Episode 112: Peter Ustinov\">episode 112<\/a>, Kermit became jealous of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Peter_Ustinov\" title=\"Peter Ustinov\">Peter Ustinov<\/a> when Fozzie, Miss Piggy, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Hilda\" title=\"Hilda\">Hilda<\/a>, and Scooter all talked about how great Peter is, especially since Fozzie and Scooter were saying things about Peter that they had previously said about Kermit. In <a href=\"\/wiki\/Episode_310:_Marisa_Berenson\" title=\"Episode 310: Marisa Berenson\">episode 310<\/a>, Miss Piggy attempted to wed Kermit by writing a sketch in which they got married, and then tricked Kermit into signing a marriage license; she even booked a real clergyman to play the part of the minister. In <a href=\"\/wiki\/Episode_410:_Kenny_Rogers\" title=\"Episode 410: Kenny Rogers\">episode 410<\/a>, Kermit hurt his flipper after falling off a trapeze, getting hit by a faulty light fixture, and later catapulting into <a href=\"\/wiki\/Statler_and_Waldorf%27s_Box\" title=\"Statler and Waldorf&#39;s Box\">Statler and Waldorf's box<\/a> (this episode put Piggy in the \"over-protective mother\" position). In <a href=\"\/wiki\/Episode_523:_Linda_Ronstadt\" title=\"Episode 523: Linda Ronstadt\">episode 523<\/a>, Miss Piggy was jealous because Kermit had a crush on guest star <a href=\"\/wiki\/Linda_Ronstadt\" title=\"Linda Ronstadt\">Linda Ronstadt<\/a> and decided to lock Kermit inside a trunk. Kermit's birthday was celebrated in <a href=\"\/wiki\/Episode_406:_Linda_Lavin\" title=\"Episode 406: Linda Lavin\">episode 406<\/a>, although at the end of the episode, it was revealed that it was actually a few months before his real birthday.\n<\/p>\n<h2 id='Movies' >Movies<\/h2>\n<p><img src='data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D' class='article-media gallery' data-ref='3' width='1920' height='1038' \/>\nFor the first three Muppet motion pictures, Kermit was very much the protagonist. His role as a leader, first established on <i>The Muppet Show<\/i>, was perpetuated in the movies as well.\n<\/p><p><i><a href=\"\/wiki\/The_Muppet_Movie\" title=\"The Muppet Movie\">The Muppet Movie<\/a><\/i>, presented to the viewer as a movie made by the Muppets to explain how they met, revolved around Kermit's journey to Hollywood and the new friends he encountered along the way, friends who shared his dream to make it big in show business. However, Kermit's motive for becoming famous was the chance to \"make millions of people happy,\" rather than financial gain. When offered to appear as the spokesfrog for the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Doc_Hopper%27s_French_Fried_Frog_Legs\" title=\"Doc Hopper&#39;s French Fried Frog Legs\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Doc Hopper's French Fried Frog Legs<\/a> restaurant chain, Kermit denied all of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Doc_Hopper\" title=\"Doc Hopper\">Doc Hopper's<\/a> requests, regardless of the threat of death by the over-zealous Doc. Two of the most well-known moments from the movie involve Kermit. One is the opening sequence, in which he sings one of his best-known songs, \"<a href=\"\/wiki\/The_Rainbow_Connection\" title=\"The Rainbow Connection\">The Rainbow Connection<\/a>\", while playing his banjo in the swamp; the other, his <a href=\"\/wiki\/Bicycles\" title=\"Bicycles\">bicycle ride<\/a> shortly after.\n<\/p><p>In <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/The_Great_Muppet_Caper\" title=\"The Great Muppet Caper\">The Great Muppet Caper<\/a><\/i>, Kermit was a reporter who traveled to England with <a href=\"\/wiki\/Fozzie_Bear\" title=\"Fozzie Bear\">Fozzie Bear<\/a> and <a href=\"\/wiki\/Gonzo\" title=\"Gonzo\">Gonzo<\/a> to investigate a jewel thief robbery. In this movie, Kermit and Fozzie portrayed themselves as identical twin brothers.\n<\/p><p>In <i>The Muppets Take Manhattan<\/i>, Kermit wrote a musical called <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Manhattan_Melodies\" title=\"Manhattan Melodies\">Manhattan Melodies<\/a><\/i>, which he attempted to put on Broadway. He also worked part-time at <a href=\"\/wiki\/Pete%27s_Luncheonette\" title=\"Pete&#39;s Luncheonette\">Pete's Luncheonette<\/a>, and wore a few disguises in his attempts to sell the show to Broadway producers. During their big Broadway premiere musical finale, Piggy tricked Kermit into marrying her.\n<\/p><p>Although he appeared as himself in <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Muppets_from_Space\" title=\"Muppets from Space\">Muppets from Space<\/a><\/i>, Kermit also took on different identities in <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/The_Muppet_Christmas_Carol\" title=\"The Muppet Christmas Carol\">The Muppet Christmas Carol<\/a><\/i>, <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/Muppet_Treasure_Island\" title=\"Muppet Treasure Island\">Muppet Treasure Island<\/a><\/i>, and the TV movie <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/The_Muppets_Wizard_of_Oz\" title=\"The Muppets Wizard of Oz\" class=\"mw-redirect\">The Muppets Wizard of Oz<\/a><\/i>, playing the roles of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Bob_Cratchit\" title=\"Bob Cratchit\">Bob Cratchit<\/a>, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Captain_Abraham_Smollett\" title=\"Captain Abraham Smollett\">Captain Abraham Smollett<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/wiki\/The_Scarecrow\" title=\"The Scarecrow\">The Scarecrow<\/a>, respectively. In all of these films, Kermit played a more secondary role, acting as part of the ensemble rather than the main character.\n<\/p><p>In 2002, Kermit was featured in the direct-to-video release <i>Kermit's Swamp Years<\/i>, which offered a glimpse into Kermit's life in the swamp as a young frog.\n<\/p><p>Also in 2002, Kermit was one of the main characters in the full-length TV movie <i><a href=\"\/wiki\/It%27s_a_Very_Merry_Muppet_Christmas_Movie\" title=\"It&#39;s a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie\">It's a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie<\/a><\/i>.
